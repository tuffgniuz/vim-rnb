    # Step 4: highlights
    #
    # You can define highlight groups like this:
    #
    #   [ "Normal",       name of the highlight group
    #     white,          the color used for background color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     darkgray,       the color used for foreground color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     "NONE"          style, can be "bold", "underline", "reverse", "italic",
    #                     "standout", "NONE", "undercurl", or a comma-separated list of
    #                     valid attributes like "underline,bold"
    #   ]
    #
    # The sample above tells Vim to render normal text in dark gray against a white
    # background, without any other styling.
    #
    # Or you can link an highlight group to another. Here, "Title" will inherit its style from
    # "Normal":
    #
    #   [ "Title", "Normal" ]
    #
    # In GUI Vim, there is an additional color for the undercurl used to
    # highlight spelling mistakes:
    #
    #   [ "SpellBad",     name of the highlight group
    #     "NONE",         the color used for background color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     red,            the color used for foreground color, or use "NONE", "fg" or "bg"
    #     "undercurl",    style
    #     red             color used for the undercurl
    #   ]
    #
    # The sample above tells Vim to render badly spelled words in red against the current
    # background, with a red undercurl.
    #
    # You can add any custom highlight group to the standard list below but you shouldn't
    # remove any if you want a working colorscheme. Most of them are described under
    # :help highlight-default, the others are taken from :help group-name. Both help sections
    # are good reads, by the way.

    # Define the color palette used by :terminal when in GUI Vim
    # or in TUI Vim when 'termguicolors' is enabled. If this list
    # is empty or if it doesn't contain exactly 16 items, the corresponding
    # Vim variable won't be set.
    #
    # The expected values are colors defined in step 3.
    #
    # Terminal emulators use a basic palette of 16 colors that can be
    # addressed by CLI and TUI tools via their name or their index, from
    # 0 to 15. The list is not really standardized but it is generally
    # assumed to look like this:
    #
    #   Index | Name
    #  -------|-------------
    #   0     | black
    #   1     | darkred
    #   2     | darkgreen
    #   3     | darkyellow
    #   4     | darkblue
    #   5     | darkmagenta
    #   6     | darkcyan
    #   7     | gray
    #   8     | darkgray
    #   9     | red

    #   12    | blue
    #   13    | magenta
    #   14    | cyan
    #   15    | white
    #
    # While you are certainly free to make colors 0 to 7 shades of blue,
    # this will inevitably cause usability issues so… be careful.

    # A few general advices:
    #
    #   * The Windows console is limited to the 16 so-called "ANSI" colors but it used to
    #     have a few of them interverted which makes numbers impractical. Use color names
    #     instead of numbers: :help cterm-colors
    #   * The Windows console (yeah…) doesn't do italics, underlines or bolded text;
    #     it is limited to normal and reverse. Keep that in mind if you want
    #     your colorscheme to be usable in as many environments as possible by as many
    #     people as possible.
    #   * Actually, terminal emulators rarely do italics.
    #   * All of the terminal emulators in use these days allow their users to
    #     change the 16 so-called "ANSI" colors. It is also possible on some platforms
    #     to change some or all of the 256 colors in the xterm palette. Don't take
    #     anything for granted.
    #   * When used against a light background, strong colors work better than muted
    #     ones. Light or dark doesn't really matters. Also, it is harder to discriminate
    #     between two similar colors on a light background.
    #   * Both strong and muted colors work well against a dark background. It is also
    #     easier to work with similar colors, but dark colors don't work at all.
    #   * Use as many text samples as possible. String-heavy languages may look completely
    #     different than keyword-heavy ones. This can have an impact on the usability
    #     of your colorscheme.
    #   * Most terminal emulators and terminal multiplexers currently in use on unix-like
    #     systems support 256 colors but they almost always default to a '$TERM' that tells
    #     Vim otherwise. Your users will need to make sure their terminal emulator/multiplexer
    #     is correctly set up if they want to enjoy the best possible experience.
